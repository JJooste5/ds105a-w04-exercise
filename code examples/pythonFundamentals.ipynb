    "\n",
    "Computers are not smart on their own — they need very explicit instructions. Every step must be clearly defined, or the computer won't understand what to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you code, you're providing detailed directions to the computer to solve problems, automate tasks, or process data. \n",
    "\n",
    "You must be extremely clear because computers don’t assume or infer anything on their own.\n"
